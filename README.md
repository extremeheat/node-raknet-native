Native RakNet bindings for Node.js

## Install

```sh
npm install raknet-native
```

Prebuilds are provided for 64-bit Windows 10, Linux and macOS Catalina. If a prebuild does not work, please create an issue and set enviornment variable FORCE_BUILD to force a manual build.

## Usage

#### class Client, Server

The Client and Server classes are JS wrappers around the internal RakClient and RakServer classes implemented in C++ in src/. See the ts/RakNet.js for usage.

#### Example

A simple generic RakNet example:

```ts
const { Client, Server, PacketPriority, PacketReliability } = require('raknet-native')
// The third paramater is for game type, you can specify 'minecraft' or leave it blank for generic RakNet
const client = new Client('127.0.0.1', 19130)
// hostname, port, serverOptions
const server = new Server('0.0.0.0', 19130, { maxConnections: 3 })
server.listen()
client.connect()
client.on('encapsulated', (buffer) => {
  console.assert(buffer.toString() == '\xA0 Hello world')
})

server.on('openConnection', (client) => {
  client.send(Buffer.from('\xA0 Hello world'), PacketPriority.HIGH_PRIORITY, PacketReliability.UNRELIABLE, 0)
})
```

For example, for Minecraft Bedrock, use:
```ts
const { Client, Server, PacketPriority } = require('raknet-native')
const client = new Client('127.0.0.1', 19130, { protocolVersion: 10 })
const server = new Server('0.0.0.0', 19130, { protocolVersion: 10, maxConnections: 3, message: Buffer.from('MCPE;Steve;2 7;0.11.0;0;20')  })
```

For more usage examples see tests/.

## Cloning
If cloning from git, you must clone the repository recursively. 

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/extremeheat/node-raknet-native.git
```

## Dependencies

For the most part, pre-builds are provided so you don't need to worry about having the correct build tools installed. But if a pre-build doesn't work or isn't avaliable, you may need to install the following deps:

#### Mac OS

You need to install xcode utilities first (this is *not* the whole Xcode!):

```
xcode-select --install
```

#### Other platforms

A valid CMake installation is required to build the library along with C++ compiler tools. CMake must be avaliable from the command line path. 

## Exported API
See index.d.ts for full API docs, a copy of the definitions are listed below:
